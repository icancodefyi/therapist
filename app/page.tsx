                  I believe that each person has the inner wisdom and the strength to heal and grow. My role as a

                  My approach is integrative, drawing from evidence-based practices such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
                  (CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), and mindfulness-based interventions. I work collaboratively
                  with my clients to develop personalized treatment plans that address their unique needs and goals.

                <p>
                  I have extensive training and experience in treating trauma, anxiety, depression, and relationship

                  meaningful change in their lives.
